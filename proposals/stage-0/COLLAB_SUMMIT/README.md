## Description

Organize an OpenJS Collaborator Summit twice a year, one in Europe and
one in the US, following the lead of the [Node.js Collaborator Summit](https://github.com/nodejs/summit).

The goal of the Collaborator Summit is to foster collaboration within
and across projects in the Foundation.

## Required Resources

* Budget for venue
* Budget for travel fund

## Who would be responsible?

A team/working group chartered under the CPC that includes
representation from all interested projects and OpenJS staff.
The team/working group will oversee the budget for the venue and the
travel fund.

## How would success be measured?

* numbers of attendees at the Summit. The one in Berlin/Europe 2019 has 70 people
attending.
* number of projects partecipating in the summit.

## Why this proposal is important

Meeting fellow collaborators in person is important for the success of
Open Source projects.

## Unresolved Question

* The Node.js TSC and CommComm jointly approve the Node.js travel fund
  requests in https://github.com/nodejs/admin. The majority of this
  budget is currently spent for attending the summit.

## What is necessary to complete this proposal

* Approval from the CPC
* Approval from the Board on the allocated budgets for 2020
