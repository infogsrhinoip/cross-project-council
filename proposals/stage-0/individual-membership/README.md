### Description

The projects of the $FOUNDATION should strive to feel more engaging and welcoming. The Individual Membership program brings together $FOUNDATION projects contributors and users – who are not current contributors – through increased participation, solicited input, and first access to some $FOUNDATION provided benefits. This program codifies a relationship with our ecosystem, and provides an opportunity for the $FOUNDATION, and member companies, to connect with engaged community members through systematic communication building.

#### Program Structure

To engage as many community members as possible, the Individual Membership program will offer three membership tiers that each confer a different level of benefit to the member. Increasing member levels correspond to increased annual fees, increased expectations of the member, and more valuable perks. Members will have the option to adjust their membership level and renew their existing membership through the proposed membership management systems, as described in a following section.

#### Program Rollout

The Individual Membership program will roll out in two phases. 

Phase 1: At launch, the program will only have a single tier. This will provide the $FOUNDATION projects early validation of the program’s utility, give program developers the opportunity to receive feedback on tooling and workflow from members, and ease initial launch overhead for the implementers.

Phase 2: The long term goal of the projects will be to deliver three membership tiers, as described below. The initial membership offering would then be known as Bronze Membership, followed by the addition of the two higher tiers in terms of perks.The delay in Silver and Gold Membership launch allow the program time to recruit corporate member perks and mature enough to provide value.

#### Individual Membership Tiers

##### Initial 2019 relaunch membership/Bronze Member ($12/yr) 

###### Rollout Target: Q4 2019

The affordability of this member class allows for folks who are excited about $FOUNDATION projects to feel part of the $FOUNDATION without putting the barrier to entry too high. This membership level affords participants:

1. The $FOUNDATION member badge – an exclusive digital membership badge and sticker 
2. Public “thank you” on the $FOUNDATION website 
3. Invitation to a quarterly town hall meeting with the CPC 
4. Bi-monthly town hall meeting with individual representation champion 
5. Access to the mailing list with monthly update 
6. Access to exclusive Individual Membership swag in the $FOUNDATION Store purchasable at cost (ex: clothing, pins, stickers) 
7. Guaranteed discount to Foundation-run events

##### Silver Member ($60/yr) 

###### Rollout Target: Q1 2020

This membership class targets participants excited to become more involved with industry tools and services by connecting with $FOUNDATION Corporate Member companies on a deeper level. This class affords participants all the benefits of Bronze Membership as well as:

1. Access to Corporate Member perks (similar to GitHub’s [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)) 
    1. Ex: Three free months of LinkedIn Learning 
2. Draw for foundation donated swag 4 times/year. ($1000/year including shipping) 
3. Foundation corporate member donated swag/goods (shared at events) 
4. 15% discount to Foundation events. 
  
##### Gold Member ($120/yr) 

###### Rollout Target: Q2 2020

A Gold Membership is for community members eager to engage closer with project administration and governance. This class affordes participants all the benefits of Silver Membership, as well as:

1. A yearly town hall style meet and greet with $FOUNDATION Board members 
2. 25% discount to Foundation events.
3. TBD
  
#### Benefits to Member Companies

- Access to an engaged audience of Node.js users 
- Corporate members are able to provide exclusive swag/resources/credits to the membership 

#### Benefits to the $FOUNDATION

- Better decision making for strategy and road map to ensure the success and sustainability of the $FOUNDATION through access to engaged $FOUNDATION project users for regular feedback 
- Increase the number of promoters for the foundation efforts through building trust and reputation of meeting the needs of the ecosystem 
  
#### Required feedback gathering on a regular cadence from members 

The Individual Membership program moving forward must understand the demographics of those being served. A voluntary self-reporting of demographics from existing collaborators and engaged users will go a long way to improving the $FOUNDATION feedback loop. It is recommended that an assigned person from the $FOUNDATION executive team be responsible for coordinating this effort directly in collaboration with the CPC. This ensures that once we are connected to engaged users, we are hearing input, acting on it, and being held accountable to needs.

The continued engagement model will include first-contact communications and highlights to members before public notice and gives the foundation the opportunity to convert the transactional relationship to caring members. 

#### Individual Membership management system

*$2100 annually*
Migrate over old system due to lack of interoperability and maintenance.

Tendenci is an open source membership management platform. $2028 per year. Cost increases to $249 per month once we hit 1000-5000 member range. Price upgrade gives us more processing power(so we could technically remain on the lower tier because it is not per-user cost and instead based off of the performance we want our users to experience). Manages signups, renewals, emails to members (currently not possible within a single system for us), news, events. Has the potential to add corporate and individual member value with the batteries-included offering, and doesn’t cost any more for these features. Example in the wild: [http://www.sfbig.org/](http://www.sfbig.org/]. Requires minimal admin IT work and an easy-to-navigate GUI that the entire $FOUNDATION internal team could access/administer along with projects members.  
  
#### Voting System for elections
CIVS

- Currently used by the rest of the Linux Foundation projects 
- Free 
- [http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/](http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/) 
- This proposal coincides with the membership management system because the prior election system we were using, Helios, is no longer being used by other projects in the LF.
  

### Required Resources

What resources would be needed to execute it?

- Administrator for elections, tooling, and communications coordination for membership 
- Tooling: membership management system and election system 
  

### Who would be responsible?

The CPC would own the maintenance and sustainability of the programs with power to delegate, and would be aided by the Executive group with resources of the $FOUNDATION to execute.

### How would success be measured?

Given the goals outlined in this proposal,

- NPS score improves by 10% after base is established 
    - With the introduction of better feedback mechanisms, we should be able to move some detractors to passives, and some passives to promoters. 
- Relaunch of program results in at least a 2X growth in active membership roster in first year of program. 

### Why this proposal is important

With the historical data we have regarding individual membership in Node.js, if Board Directors wish for the Individual Membership to be representative of the larger umbrella projects engaged ecosystem, we know that the number of members prior and the number of members who voted was not statistically significant nor representative. The Individual Membership did not have a clear path, role, or definition and all three are required in order to set the program up for success and provide proper service to these member programs. 

*The goals of the proposed program include:*

- To give a voice and direction to a larger and different group than core collaborators of projects. To feel bought into the $FOUNDATION. 
- To have a visible association with the foundation 
- They see direct benefit through the swag, resources, etc. 

*How does this program achieve this?*

- Provides the interested but not yet fully engaged members the path to engagement and voice 
- Operationalizes programs that focus on folks who are more engaged and interested in giving and getting feedback outside of the collaborator base on the project and foundation work through guaranteed communications, surveys, better evangelists prepared with exclusive information ahead of the world to provide this value. 

### What is necessary to complete this proposal

1. Approval of this proposal from projects building the $FOUNDATION, the Node.js Board of Directors, and JSF Board of Directors
2. A continued commitment by the CPC in conjunction with the Executive group
