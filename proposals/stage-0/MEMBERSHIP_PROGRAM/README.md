## Description

The goals of the Individual Membership Program are to help bring awareness about both large and small projects to possible contributors. A way for individuals to show support and be a part of the OpenJS foundation, as well as providing an opportunity for community with the other members. 

While one goal of this group is introducing members to projects and helping the projects find the support they need; the membership program will also be an opportunity to welcome an inclusive group of coders from around the world that love the projects that are part of the OpenJS foundation. This also brings in new perspectives and feedback from the vast community of JavaScript developers.

Additionally, Individual membership should help people understand that their projects too can get support from the foundation, and the OpenJS foundation is their foundation. 
A tertiary goal is to establish a pool from which an ambassador program can be started. Recognizing people that evangelize and recruit for OpenJS projects. 

## Membership Benefits

Members of this program [name TBD] will receive an members-only weekly newsletter keeping them up to date on the last from OpenJS projects, the CPC, and the board. They will be invited to participate in discussions about governance and new initiatives. 

They will be featured on our global membership page, and will be given a digital badge that they can put on an avatar, their blog, and/or personal website. 

Additionally, they will receive discounts for training, certification, conferences, and potentially exclusive offers from member organizations. 

Lastly, members will have access to the member store where they can purchase OpenJS member swag to show their support for our projects. Revenue from swag will go towards furthering the reach of the foundation. 


## Membership Cost

Membership is charged at $25/year. Membership is renewed 1 year from the date of your membership. Members can cancel at any time and not be charged for the next year. 

Members will be required to comply with the Code of Conduct, and may be subject to removal upon violation. 

## Required Resources

What resources would be needed to execute it?
* The current weekly newsletter signup is removed from the OpenJS website. 
    * Existing subscribers will not be removed
    * As people sign up for membership they will be added to the mailing list
    * They can request removal at any time
    * Optional additional email content, such as “What is the CPC and how can I get involved” can be set up via an email drip campaign for new members. 
* Design
    * OpenJS Member badges, avatars, and swag
* Web
    * A page to reflect current membership on the website
    * A swag store for members (turnkey)
    * A sign up page for membership with a payment gateway that allows for subscriptions

## Who would be responsible?

The CPC would own the maintenance and sustainability of the program with OpenJS Foundation staff support along with iterating on the program and ensuring the member needs are heard and accounted for. 

## How would success be measured?

* Growth of the membership list
* Quantifiable public advocacy from members for the OpenJS foundation and projects
* An increase in contributors to projects from small to large

## What is necessary to complete this proposal

Approval of this proposal from project members of the NF and JSF, the Node.js Board of Directors, and the JSF Board of Directors
