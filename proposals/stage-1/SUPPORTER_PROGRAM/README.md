>  Stage 1

## Champion

[Sara Chipps](https://github.com/sarajo)
 
## Description

Membership program for OpenJS individual supporters. 

## Required Resources

What resources would be needed to execute it?
* Workflow to add new supporters to monthly email 
    * Existing subscribers will not be removed
    * They can request removal at any time
    * Optional additional email content, such as “What is the CPC and how can I get involved” can be set up via an email drip campaign for new supporters. 
* Design
    * JavaScriptlandia logo, passports, avatars, and swag
* Web
    * A page to reflect current membership on the website
    * A swag store for supporters (turnkey)
    * A sign up page for membership with a payment gateway that allows for subscriptions
    * Possibly a page with a passport that you can add stamps to?
* Foundation
    * Support for the members of the program (questions, emails, updates)
    * Ensuring that the membership program is continually promoted and growing
    * Help with running periodic satisfaction surveys (NPS or related)

## Who would be responsible?

The CPC would own the maintenance and sustainability of the program with OpenJS Foundation staff support along with iterating on the program and ensuring the supporter needs are heard and accounted for. 

## How would success be measured?

* Growth of the membership list
* Quantifiable public advocacy from supporters for the OpenJS foundation and projects
* An increase in contributors to projects from small to large
* More attendees at weekly CPC meetings, and additional CPC members

## What is necessary to complete this proposal

Approval of this proposal from project members of the NF and JSF, the Node.js Board of Directors, and the JSF Board of Directors

##Open Questions

* What should the income from the supporter program go towards? 
* What should the landing page be like, can we give members "passports"? 

##Timeline

Our goal to roll out this program will be Q4, permitting everything goes smoothly.
