>  Stage 1

## Description

Membership program for OpenJS individual supporters. 

## Required Resources

What resources would be needed to execute it?
* The current weekly newsletter signup is removed from the OpenJS website. 
    * Existing subscribers will not be removed
    * As people sign up to be an individual supporter they will be added to the mailing list
    * They can request removal at any time
    * Optional additional email content, such as “What is the CPC and how can I get involved” can be set up via an email drip campaign for new supporters. 
* Design
    * OpenJS Member badges, avatars, and swag
* Web
    * A page to reflect current membership on the website
    * A swag store for supporters (turnkey)
    * A sign up page for membership with a payment gateway that allows for subscriptions

## Who would be responsible?

The CPC would own the maintenance and sustainability of the program with OpenJS Foundation staff support along with iterating on the program and ensuring the supporter needs are heard and accounted for. 

## How would success be measured?

* Growth of the membership list
* Quantifiable public advocacy from supporters for the OpenJS foundation and projects
* An increase in contributors to projects from small to large

## What is necessary to complete this proposal

Approval of this proposal from project members of the NF and JSF, the Node.js Board of Directors, and the JSF Board of Directors

##Open Questions

* Should the newsletter become a benefit of this program? If not, what are some ways we can incentivize membership? Will people join just to show their support for our projects?
* What should the income from the supporter program go towards?
