# OpenJS Foundation / Google Season of Docs 2020

The [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org) is applying for the [2020 Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs).

The [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org) is made up of 32 open source JavaScript projects including Appium, Dojo, jQuery, Node.js, and webpack. We are currently incubating projects as well, including AMP, Electron, nvm, and fastify.

Our mission is to support the healthy growth of JavaScript and web technologies by providing a neutral organization to host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.

We are looking for a few skilled technical writers who can help with a number of our projects.  We have a large, welcoming community and would like to help grow new participants.

If you have any questions, please reach out on the [OpenJS Foundation Slack](https://slack.openjsf.org).

Here is a list of our proposals, as well as some resources to help you learn about the OpenJS Foundation.
